# Anticoronavirals-Classifier-using-DeepChem
Classifier and predictions for anti-coronavirals drug repurposing

- datasets/antivirals_SMILES.csv - main dataset to calculate descriptores using SMILES of antiviral compounds; to build the best QSAR model
- datasets/DB_SMILES4prediction.csv - external dataset used to calculate descriptors for DrugBank molecules to predict antiviral activity for drug repurposing
- antivirals_predictions.csv - the predictions with the best model for drug repurposing
